# Stan_Bayesian_Modeling
Bayesian Modeling Scripts in Python using Stan

Note compiled Stan files (.pkl) are ignored by git so if you
clone this repository you have to compile the models in
'compiled_models.dir' in your python directory.

Please make sure you have the latest version of PyStan. The earlier 
versions gave me segmentation fault errors for some chains.
